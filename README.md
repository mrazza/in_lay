# in_lay

in_lay was an old project back from 2009 designed as a fully-skinnable, fast, and powerful media player based entirely around playlists. This repo is an import from CodePlex.
This project is not supported and may not run.

Three major sub-projects exist in this repo (beyond the in_lay application itself):
- netAudio: C# audio playback library via interop to an (now old) version of libVLC
- netGooey: Skinnable WPF UI framework
- netDiscographer: Storage-independent media library (with SQLite implementation)
